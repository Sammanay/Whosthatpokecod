# Sort rules 

These are rules as to how Pok√©mon would be sorted:

* Main color palette
    * The color/s should be more than 50% of the Pokemons body ( Bulbasaur is nearly 100% green so it would qualify for this under green but Cosmog has multiple colors and, therefore, cannot qualify for this. 
    
*
