# Sort rules 

These are rules as to how Pok√©mon would be sorted:

* Main color palette
   * The color/s should be more than 50% of the Pokemons body ( Bulbasaur is nearly 100% green so it would qualify for this under green but Cosmog has multiple colors and, therefore, cannot qualify for this. 
    
* Number of legs
   * This is determined by how many legs the Pokemon has as shown in the Pokecord sprites.
   * Because some pokemon have legs but don't walk on them, the Pokemon must be on said legs and not flying in the Pokecord sprites ( e.g Charizard would qualify for being sorted like this and would fall under 2 because they are walking on those legs while Mew would not qualify for this because they are not on the ground)

* Irl Counterpart
  * Determined by looking at real world counterparts. 
  * They aren't given in specifics, just in general terms (e.g Spearow would fall under bird and not sparrow) 

* Main Shape 
  * Determined by looking at the main shape of a pokemon.
  * Shapes must be geometric,therefore Charizard doesn't qualify for this, but Togepi would 
  
* Type it looks like 
  * Determined by what type it looks like
  * Types and how they look like are as follows:
